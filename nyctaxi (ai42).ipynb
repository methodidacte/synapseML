If a list/tuple of\n          param maps is given, this calls fit on each param map and returns a list of\n          models.\n      \n      Returns\n      -------\n      :py:class:`Transformer` or a list of :py:class:`Transformer`\n          fitted model(s)\n  \n  fitMultiple(self, dataset, paramMaps)\n      Fits a model to the input dataset for each param map in `paramMaps`.\n      \n      .. versionadded:: 2.3.0\n      \n      Parameters\n      ----------\n      dataset : :py:class:`pyspark.sql.DataFrame`\n          input dataset.\n      paramMaps : :py:class:`collections.abc.Sequence`\n          A Sequence of param maps.\n      \n      Returns\n      -------\n      :py:class:`_FitMultipleIterator`\n          A thread safe iterable which contains one model for each param map. Each\n          call to `next(modelIterator)` will return `(index, model)` where model was fit\n          using `paramMaps[index]`. `index` values may not be sequential.\n  \n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Methods inherited from pyspark.ml.param.Params:\n  \n  explainParam(self, param)\n      Explains a single param and returns its name, doc, and optional\n      default value and user-supplied value in a string.\n  \n  explainParams(self)\n      Returns the documentation of all params with their optionally\n      default values and user-supplied values.\n  \n  extractParamMap(self, extra=None)\n      Extracts the embedded default param values and user-supplied\n      values, and then merges them with extra values from input into\n      a flat param map, where the latter value is used if there exist\n      conflicts, i.e., with ordering: default param values &lt;\n      user-supplied values &lt; extra.\n      \n      Parameters\n      ----------\n      extra : dict, optional\n          extra param values\n      \n      Returns\n      -------\n      dict\n          merged param map\n  \n  getOrDefault(self, param)\n      Gets the value of a param in the user-supplied param map or its\n      default value. Raises an error if neither is set.\n  \n  getParam(self, paramName)\n      Gets a param by its name.\n  \n  hasDefault(self, param)\n      Checks whether a param has a default value.\n  \n  hasParam(self, paramName)\n      Tests whether this instance contains a param with a given\n      (string) name.\n  \n  isDefined(self, param)\n      Checks whether a param is explicitly set by user or has\n      a default value.\n  \n  isSet(self, param)\n      Checks whether a param is explicitly set by user.\n  \n  set(self, param, value)\n      Sets a parameter in the embedded param map.\n  \n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Readonly properties inherited from pyspark.ml.param.Params:\n  \n  params\n      Returns all params ordered by name. The default implementation\n      uses :py:func:`dir` to get all attributes of type\n      :py:class:`Param`.\n  \n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Methods

Each\n          call to `next(modelIterator)` will return `(index, model)` where model was fit\n          using `paramMaps[index]`. `index` values may not be sequential.\n  \n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Methods inherited from pyspark.ml.param.Params:\n  \n  explainParam(self, param)\n      Explains a single param and returns its name, doc, and optional\n      default value and user-supplied value in a string.\n  \n  explainParams(self)\n      Returns the documentation of all params with their optionally\n      default values and user-supplied values.\n  \n  extractParamMap(self, extra=None)\n      Extracts the embedded default param values and user-supplied\n      values, and then merges them with extra values from input into\n      a flat param map, where the latter value is used if there exist\n      conflicts, i.e., with ordering: default param values &lt;\n      user-supplied values &lt; extra.\n      \n      Parameters\n      ----------\n      extra : dict, optional\n          extra param values\n      \n      Returns\n      -------\n      dict\n          merged param map\n  \n  getOrDefault(self, param)\n      Gets the value of a param in the user-supplied param map or its\n      default value. Raises an error if neither is set.\n  \n  getParam(self, paramName)\n      Gets a param by its name.\n  \n  hasDefault(self, param)\n      Checks whether a param has a default value.\n  \n  hasParam(self, paramName)\n      Tests whether this instance contains a param with a given\n      (string) name.\n  \n  isDefined(self, param)\n      Checks whether a param is explicitly set by user or has\n      a default value.\n  \n  isSet(self, param)\n      Checks whether a param is explicitly set by user.\n  \n  set(self, param, value)\n      Sets a parameter in the embedded param map.\n  \n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Readonly properties inherited from pyspark.ml.param.Params:\n  \n  params\n      Returns all params ordered by name.
